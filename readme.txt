Crop images at lightspeed by adjusting focal points. Easier and faster than ever before!

== Description ==

Image Focus is an image crop plugin which leaves the traditional path of image cropping.

With Image Focus you can instead crop your image by focal point. You select the most important part of your images. And Image Focus will create a crop with your focal point as much in the center as possible.

This way you don't need to crop all your images size by size. It will intelligently crop all sizes by your selected focus point.

Any documentation can be found on: [Image Focus GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/DannyvanHolten/image-focus)
